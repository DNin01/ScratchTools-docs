# Building a Feature
It's simple and easy to contribute to ScratchTools. Most people, when contributing in code, build features. This way, ScratchTools users can have even more amazing additions to the Scratch website. Here's how to build your own feature and add it to ScratchTools.
### What Makes a Feature, a Feature?
A ScratchTools feature is a special tool that can be easily enabled/disabled from the ScratchTools settings. It makes Scratch even better, and users can use the feature to create Scratch projects or interact with the Scratch website.
### Fork the Repository
Start by [forking the official ScratchTools repository](https://github.com/STForScratch/ScratchTools/fork). This is where all the code is, and you will be making changes in your fork. Please make sure to name it something appropriate and relevant.
