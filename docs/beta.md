# Installing Beta
If you want to install the beta version of ScratchTools or your own fork of ScratchTools, it's simple and important. It's nice for you and for other developers when you're able to test out your features and changes before making pull requests- or, you just want a sneak peak at some awesome new features.
## Downloading Zip
There are two ways of installing the beta version- if you don't plan on updating the extension often, and don't plan on making your own changes, [here's a simple video](https://youtu.be/41gMwlP7A4I) on how to install it. The steps are also below.
### Go to GitHub
Start by going to [the official ScratchTools repository](https://github.com/stforscratch/scratchtools). Once you're there, click on the green button that says "Code". From the dropdown, select "Download ZIP". A new file will be installed. If it's a `.zip` file, unpack it first. If it's a folder, you don't need to unpack it.
### Go to the Extensions Page
Go to [Chrome's extensions page](chrome://extensions) to easily load in the new folder. Make sure that the toggle in the top right corner (labeled "Developer mode") is turned on. Then, drag your folder onto the page. A new extension will appear- don't get it mixed up with other versions of ScratchTools that you might have installed!
## Downloading Fork
For developers, this is the most efficient way of downloading. However, you will need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and you'll want a text-editing application (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a default application) installed.
### Fork
Start by [forking the ScratchTools repository](https://github.com/stforscratch/scratchtools/fork). This will create your own copy of the repository that you can make changes to, and eventually open a pull request from.
### Add Fork to GitHub Desktop
After signing into GitHub Desktop, add your fork to your device from the app (Add > Clone Repository). Search and select your fork, and then make sure to specify where you want to save the fork on your device. It will create a new folder will all the files.
### Go to the Extensions Page
Go to [Chrome's extensions page](chrome://extensions) to easily load in the new folder. Make sure that the toggle in the top right corner (labeled "Developer mode") is turned on. Then, drag your folder onto the page. A new extension will appear- don't get it mixed up with other versions of ScratchTools that you might have installed!
