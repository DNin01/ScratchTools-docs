# ScratchTools Docs
ScratchTools is a browser extension that works to make Scratch better for all Scratchers! We're the fastest-growing Scratch browser extension, and we're community-run, too!

If you want to know more or if there's something specific you want to learn about, browse through the docs or ask our developers something on our [community Discord server](https://scratchtools.app/discord)!

## Contributing to the Docs
It's simple and easy to contribute to the documentation - just as easy as it is to contribute to ScratchTools! To contribute to the docs, go to [the official repository](https://github.com/stforscratch/docs).
